# hello-world
just another repository


Hey people! I suck at coding. I am good a graphic design. But for some reason I am torturing myself with this shit. Mainly because I work production at a car factory and I am trying to expand my brain in an environment of very stupid conversations.

I like Adderall and Chocolate. I love my Pittbull, being outdoors and my girlfriend.
